Short info on levels
--------------------
VladBot supports three different userlists, with each their own levels:
- opperlist: The name is kinda misleading. A better name would be accesslist
             or userlist (latter will sometimes be used, but internally, this
	     list is still called opperlist)
	     Levels available are:
	     0	 -	No priviliges. Only simple commands like NOTE, TIME,
	     		WHOAMI etc. can be used (see on_msg_commands in 
			vlad-ons.c)
	     50  - 	User will be opped, can ask the bot to INVITE him/her
	     		and can make the bot GIVEOP to people.
	     100 -	User is allowed to modify userlists (using NUSERADD,
	     		NSHITADD and NPROTADD), can make the bot "OPEN" the
			channel (remove bans, keys and limit), make the bot
			UNBAN him/her.
	     125 -	User has semi-operator access. All commands except DO,
	     		QUIT, GLOBAL DIE, REHASH and FORK can be accessed
	     150 -	Operator level, user can do anything
	     		
- shitlist:  The shitlist restricts certain users from accessing the bot/channel
	     0   -	Nothing happens (equal to not being shitted)
	     50  -	User cannot access any commands except a few (see 
	     		on_msg_command in vlad-ons.c). The bot won't allow
			this user to be opped.
	     100 - 	User is not allowed to join the channel and will be
	     		kicked+banned when trying to.

- protlist:  The protlist makes the bot protect certain users:
	     0   -	No protection
	     100 -	Full protection agains deopping (in future also against
	     		kicking and banning)

These settings can be changed by changing the on_msg_commands table in vlad-ons.c,
which has the following structure:

"COMMAND_NAME", function, u_lvl, s_lvl, FORCE_DCC
u_lvl 		= minimum required userlevel
s_lvl 		= maximum allowed shitlevel
FORCE_DCC	= If true, a dcc-chat conenction is required for this command.
