== Achille 2.1hi-51 ==
French Vladbot fork from 1996 with added AI code and commands.


== Ariela ==
A fork off of Vladb ot 2.1c with a few minor registered only users tweaks for
Barron and President. Bot seems to have been in use on Undernet.


== Bot 0.01 ==
Very early bot, by Peyote Coyote which evolved into Hopbot. The bot.c file
has the following comment: 11/7/91 - Peyote Coyote. Less advanced than Hopbot.


== Combot 1.0.5 ==
An early version of the Combot. This one comes with the configuration and logs
from a bot called 'chakal'.


== Dweebot ==
A Combot branch. Even though the config identify it as 0.3a, the readme 
identifies it as 0.6a and lists changes from 0.3a.


== Extramech gudelia ==
WARNING: Sourceforge reported this as possibly including malware. This is a 
fork of the Energymech bot, with services support and extra documentation in
spanish. Listed on source forge as irc-world.org. Contains some misc tools.


==Hackbot 0.90-alpha 13 ==
Early version of the hackbot/combot linneage, by Comstud. There is also a 
slightly older alpha 12 in the archive.


== HopBot ==
File: hop1.8.tar.Z

[bot.c] Bot v0.01   11/7/91 - Peyote Coyote  Generic bot shell
[ strcasestr ] NOT used. I just pulled it out of Sagebot for possible future use.


== PC Bot 0.01 ==
This seems to be an intermediate step between Bot 0.01 and Hopbot. It has much 
more  functionality than Bot did. Hopbot has much of the same functionality, 
but it has been organzed better, into more source files. 


== Vladbot 1.9m ==
File: vladbot-1.9m.tar.gz

VladBot was originally based on HopBot but has changed so much, there is hardly
any resemblance left. For DCC and other things, I took parts from the ircII 2.2.9
client. This is (also) why VladBot is released under the GNU Copyright.

== Vladbot-2.1h-hip ==
A few memory fixes, vladbomb removal, added two commands and removed some of 
the more hostile channel protection functionality.


== VladBot 2.2a-PhB ==
Looks like a translation fork / personalization of a VladBot 2.1h. It has a lot of 
the replies and commands translated into french. Some command levels have been
changed.
