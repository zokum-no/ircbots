== Achille 2.1hi-51 ==
French Vladbot fork from 1996 with added AI code and commands.


== Bot 0.01 ==
Very early bot, by Peyote Coyote which evolved into Hopbot. The bot.c file
has the following comment: 11/7/91 - Peyote Coyote. Less advanced than Hopbot.


== Combot 1.0.5 ==
An early version of the Combot. This one comes with the configuration and logs
from a bot called 'chakal'.


== Combot 2.0.6 ==
The last version I could find. Has many additions, cleaned up source, no
documentation other than the help file. Supports 'ccc' a system to replicate
list changes to another bot.


== DivBot ==
Not much to say, don't have Linux binaries, but strings will tell mw what
commands it supports.

== Dweebot ==
A Combot branch. Even though the config identify it as 0.3a, the readme 
identifies it as 0.6a and lists changes from 0.3a.


== Extramech gudelia ==
WARNING: Sourceforge reported this as possibly including malware. This is a 
fork of the Energymech bot, with services support and extra documentation in
spanish. Listed on source forge as irc-world.org. Contains some misc tools.


== fRitE 3.0 ==
A  modified Vladbot, version 3.0. Originally by VladDrac, (fRitE) heavily 
modded by PosterBoy. Code also included by TheFuture, and Holocaine. Official 
Ascii Bot of the UnderNet.


== fRitE 4.1 alpha ==
Source has been cleaed up, war functions were added. Many other additions.


== Hackbot 0.90-alpha 13 ==
Early version of the hackbot/combot linneage, by Comstud. There is also a 
slightly older alpha 12 in the archive.


== HofBot ==
A bot based on Hackbot, with a bunch of fixes. Found it on wayback's archive
of Proton, the emech coder's site.

== HopBot ==
File: hop1.8.tar.Z

[bot.c] Bot v0.01   11/7/91 - Peyote Coyote  Generic bot shell
[ strcasestr ] NOT used. I just pulled it out of Sagebot for possible future 
use.


== IncuBot ==
Incubus fork, which was done in parallell with the Chronic bot and incorporated
BadCRC's changes. The archive comes with many obsolete files and txt files from
the bots it was based on. The 1.03 beta has more code from The Black's bot.


== PC Bot 0.01 ==
This seems to be an intermediate step between Bot 0.01 and Hopbot. It has much 
more  functionality than Bot did. Hopbot has much of the same functionality, 
but it has been organzed better, into more source files. 


== Starbot ==
A service bot for the Starlink irc network. The code is according to the 
current irc network staff lost. The coder behind it has passed away.


== StelBot 1.0 ==
A fork of Combot done by Brian 'Bryan8' Karrade. Has a few new commands and
an updated help file.


== StelBot 1.2 ==
Some more new commands, more polish, removed references to being a ComBot.


== TnT-II 5.7f ==
Hackbot fork by ttone (tonys@access.mountain.net). Contains code form johbot.
It seems it was only distributed as two types archives. One type consists of
multiple a machine-specific binary for Linux, SunOS, FreeBSD etc. The other
type is a pack with documentation, examples, changelogs, html manual, all the
non-binary files.


== Vladbot 1.9m ==
File: vladbot-1.9m.tar.gz

VladBot was originally based on HopBot but has changed so much, there is hardly
any resemblance left. For DCC and other things, I took parts from the ircII 2.2.9
client. This is (also) why VladBot is released under the GNU Copyright.

== Vladbot 2.1c-ariela ==
A fork off of Vlad bot 2.1c with a few minor registered only users tweaks for
Barron and President. Bot seems to have been in use on Undernet. Minor changes
in the Makefile, config.h etc.

A few memory fixes, vladbomb removal, added two commands and removed some of 
the more hostile channel protection functionality.

Removed the note functionality, different config files. Allows for larger dcc 
files, some minor level changes and defaults changed.


== Vladbot 2.1-sk3 ==
Partially translated to french. FTP-DCC functionality commented out, some new
list types were added. Used to run a bot called Patrocle.


== VladBot 2.2a-PhB ==
Looks like a translation fork / personalization of a VladBot 2.1h. It has a lot of 
the replies and commands translated into french. Some command levels have been
changed.
