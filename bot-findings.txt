VladBot was originally based on HopBot but has changed so much, there is hardly
any resemblance left. For DCC and other things, I took parts from the ircII 2.2.9
client. This is (also) why VladBot is released under the GNU Copyright.

Looks like a translation fork / personalization of aV ladBot 2.1h. It has a lot of 
the replies and commands translated into french. Some command levels have been
changed.
