RockBot6 development pre-distribution
-------------------------------------

Congratulations, and thank you for helping to test RockBot6 during
its development cycle.  You will need some experiance compiling
and running things in the unix enviornment to use this bot, and please
keep in mind many aspects of RockBot6 are not yet finished.

Liscence
--------
RockBot is released under the GNU Public liscence. Please see the liscence
included with the distribution.

Quick install Directions
------------------------
cd RockBot
./configure
make
cp -r Demo MyBot
pico MyBot/global.dat
./RockBot MyBot


Basic Install Instructions
--------------------------
Untar the archive (it will make a dir, RockBot/)
$ tar -xzf RockBot.tgz   #(or whatever your file is called)

Change to the directory RockBot/
$ cd RockBot

run the configure script (./configure)
if you want to install somewhere besides here, use the configure
options, eg ./configure --prefix="/usr/local/rockbot".  
see ./configure --help 
when you run the configure script, it will examine your system and build appropreate makefiles for you (hopefully..)
$ ./configure

Look over source/Makefile and source/config.h make any changes necessary.  
Run "make" to compile.  If your machine took 
spesific changes to compile please write up a nice detailed description and
email it to me (rubin@afternet.org).
$ make

Rename the "Demo" directory to a directory describing your bot. (each 
"bot" gets its own directory out of the main RockBot/ directory) Anything 
works, as long as its diferentiable from other bots you run off the same 
binary.  (MyBot) for example..   (Its not a good idea to use punctuation though.).
$ cp -r Demo MyBot

Change into your bots data directory and modify global.dat to reflect your 
information.  Be carefull not to break the syntax.  See documentation in 
that file for help. some day i hope to build a script to do this for you.
$ cd MyBot
$ pico MyBot/global.dat

Change back to the main RockBot/ directory and execute the bot.  The 
syntax is "RockBot <dirname>" where <dirname> is the directory the data
files are in (relitive to the RockBot binary).  Example:> ./RockBot Ender
$ cd ..
$ RockBot MyBot

With any luck it will start.. if not you'll have to try to figure it out
yourself unless you can convince me to take time out of my very busy schedule 
to offer help.  Try to find me on Afternet (irc.afternet.org:#Afternet)

Things not yet done (that i remember)
-------------------------------------
* Need to write a nice friendly first time build-a-new-bot
  thing, like version 5 had.
* There are still bugs in the ban system...still.
* The kick-say kicks arnt working.
* Help is still badly out of date (although updated somewhat)
* Several commands are not yet working. I keep working down the list,
  but theres a lot, and I'm not even necessarily aware of it all. If 
  you find a bug let me know. 
* The bot likes to undo peoples bans. It seems to think a ban like *foo*@* matches
  a users hostmask of *rubin@*.loxxin.net because I could be rubin!foorubin@shoe.loxxin.net.
  While this is true, the bot needs to only undo bans that actually spesifically match
  someones hostmask. Not quite sure how to solve this. The matching code claims to solve
  this problem but apparently not..
* The nickname code is not quite right. In some cases the bot won't get its wanted
  nick when it becomes free. 

Update 7/16/01
--------------
* I've streamlined the login procedures a bit. If you have the password,
  the AUTH command will now get you access regarless if you match a host
  in the bot or not. If not, one will be added that matches you (but marked
  as insecure, so you'll still need to login for access next time)
* Added the base of "RESPONDERS" that will let the bot do script-like things,
  such as login to another bot or service. They arnt functional yet though.

Update 4/17/01
--------------
* Installed autconf (./configure) scripts, and rebuilt the makefiles.
* Built proper header files for each .c file
* removed all warnings when compiling with -Wall -pedantic
* Fixed a few bugs in the process
* Changed the way rockbot sends messages to the server:
  Now, each message is stored in a queue, with a priority
  based on what the message is, and who its for/from.
  The bot can now send you large ammounts of data on irc
  without interfering with normal processies. higher users
  can get there output first, so lamers flooding the bot are only
  annoying themselves.
* Removed the requirement that long messages be sent in DCC. DCC link
  with the bot is now optional (the CHAT command). Output on irc is slower
  then DCC output though, obviously.
* Fixed a bug with remchan deleting global.dat by mistake.
* Many bugfixes

Update 2/4/99
-------------
* Added virtual host support. Define VHOST in config.h to the IP 
  you want the bot to bind to and it should bind to it (:
* Fixed the userhost file save functions to actually save.  This
  should help the SEEN feature work better *grin*

Update 1/30/99
--------------
* The ban system is functional again. Sorry for those bugs, i
  was adding the "NICK!" part to the userhost twice.
* The UNBAN system is functional again. The parse function
  wasnt calling add_ban and delete_ban as it should have been.
* ADDHOST is now fixed, i decided for simplicity sake it just
  always requires a password.  I'll make another, different command
  for admins to add users hosts (addhost will be only for a user
  to add his or her own hosts).
* The CALC function was added. This is the first of infobot.c, another
  file which will hold the infobot functions.
* the ROLL or D command was fixed to work in private msg correctly.
* AUTH was modified to default to the global list if local access
  doesnt exist. (so /msg bot auth without a cmdchar will work.)
* Modified the ignore system so it shouldnt ignore high bot level
  users (such as botcoowner and botowner).  I've re-enabled the
  sometimes annoying message that gets set to you when your being
  ignored.. mostly for debugging.  Maybe i'll make it into a #define.

Update  1/23/99
---------------
* NOTE: Database format change! Do not use dev-101r's data
  files with dev-103.  See the file README.UPGRADE-TO-103 for
  more information.
* Added many commands to help such as addhost, and setsecurity.
* Fixed a few commands, such as CLVL (now accepts word levels).
* Password Security system in place. May still be buggy, but its mostly
  implimented.  New commands: AUTH and SETSECURITY.

Important Changes from RockBot 5.x and lower
--------------------------------------------
The data files and memory model were totally
re-written.  RockBot now uses a multiple-channel
scheme for keeping track of users, and also
allows one user to store multiple hostmasks under
one "handle".  There is also a "global" config that
controls the default settings for channels and
high level bot users.  In order to diferentiate
between global commands and local channel commands
the following syntax has been implimented:
(Note: This example assumes CMDCHAR is '!')
Sent to a channel -> !userlist             = userlist of the channel typed in
Sent to a channel -> !#mychannel userlist  = userlist of #mychannel
Sent to a channel -> !!userlist            = global userlist
---
Privmsg to bot -> #mychan userlist      = userlist of #mychan
Privmsg to bot -> !userlist             = global userlist
---
When you use JOIN a data file will be created to contain the
new channels users, settings, topic etc.  The LEAVE command
parts the bot but does NOT remove the datafiles, however REMCHAN does.


An important note about RockBot and DCC
---------------------------------------
As always, rockbot has used a very different
DCC model from bots like eggdrop. In
RockBot YOU NEVER initiate a DCC chat with
the bot. In all cases the bot will send you
a DCC chat request when it needs one due to
the type of data its returning. If you have 
trouble with DCC's it may be the bot cannot
determine its true IP address on the machine.
Try playing with "#define PPP" in config.h.

UPDATE: I have done a lot of work to make it
so that rockbot can communicate with NOTICES
and not get lagged, by using a priority queue
system. Now that this is done, i have turned
off the DCC requirement in rockbot!
You can still get the bot to dcc chat you
by issuing the CHAT command.
