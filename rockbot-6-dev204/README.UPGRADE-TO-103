NOTE: The database format has changed slightly from release 101r to 103!

this means you cannot use the same data files you were previously using.  There
is only manual conversion available at this point, here is an example:

Old format:
USER *!*captain@*.rdrop.com Captain * 61 2 1 *
USER *!*rubin@*.rdrop.com Rubin mypass 100 5 1 Thine Creator!
HOST *!*rubin@*.anotherhost.com

New format:
USER *!*captain@*.rdrop.com Captain * 61 2 1 0 *
USER *!*rubin@*.rdrop.com Rubin mypass 100 5 1 0 Thine Creator!
HOST *!*rubin@*.anotherhost.com 0


Note the additional paramiter added to both HOST and USER.  You can
add it as a "0" in your existing data files, or just delete and re-create them.

You will also need to delete the UPDIR and BOTDIR lines from global.dat. They
are no longer needed and will cause an error.

I appologize for the change but there didnt seem to be enough users of the dev releases
to justify the energy to write a conversion utility.
