- Add zircon support. I think the %-idea is quite good
  (like: %chat etc...)
- Rewrite the fd-stuff again (as Lindsay
  suggested...)                       
- Add multiple servers (for undernet) (severe hacking?)
 PHASE 1:
	Add a server list and put all botinfo (as nick, serversocket)
	in one struct. When the server goes down, the bot should be able
	to reconnect to another server from the serverlist

	(Perhaps but irrelevant stuff from server.c to vladbot.c, and
	 rename vlad-bot.c into main.c)
  :
  :
 PHASE X:
	Make a list of these structs
- Add some sort of configurationscripts by which bots can be defined, i.e.

# Sample.cfg

Bot "NederServ" {
	Name "/msg NederServ !help";
	servers { "ircserver.et.tudelft.nl", "irc.funet.fi" };	
	Channels { "#dutch", "#Holland" };
}
# NederServ on the undernet 
Bot "NederServ" {
	Name "/msg NederServ !help";
	servers "delft.undernet.org";	# whatever
	Channels { "#WasteLand", "#Dutch" };
}
# Prince Service bot
Bot "UpTown" {
	Name "/msg UpTown !files";
	servers "irc.funet.fi";
	Channels "#prince";
}
# end
	
- Add some usefull things...;
 Games, services, messaging system
