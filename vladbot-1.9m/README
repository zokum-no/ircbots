Readme for release 1.7 of VladBot
=================================

This is the first public release for VladBot (for now only via DCC from NederServ,
later also via FTP). VladBot is still in an alpha/beta stage. Anyone who wants
to help porting it to other Operating systems, please notify me.

Release 1.6 now supports:
-------------------------
- Three "lists", user - prot and shit. New lists can be added quite easily
- DCC chat for faster communication
- DCC send/get for filetransfer
- (Mass) opping/kicking etc. VladBot was never meant to be a masskick/op bot,
  I won't add anymore of these features in future releases.
- Internal liststructures like a channellist by which the bot can recall
  on which channels it is (handy if the bot gets kicked).

New in 1.7
----------
- Logging has been added (error and dcc)
- VladBot now runs on Ultrix (thanx Richie :)
- Lots of bugfixes. Massop/kick/ban is still broke
- Helpfunction is quite complete now (thanx again, richie)
- More....

New in 1.8
----------
- DCC timeout, if a dcc connection is idle for DCC_TIMEOUT secs, it'll
  be closed
- FILEUPLOADDIR - files that are uploaded can be put in a seperate dir,
  this protects ppl. from overwriting existing files.
- (version 1.8b) When a command is sent private, no ! is needed
- Some fancy stuff, !info now shows uptime etc. !listdcc has been reformatted
  (look at it)
- The bot now waits a definable (WAIT_SEC and WAIT_MSEC) amount of time when
  it's reading information from a socket. This slows things down a little,
  but the bot now takes much less systemresources. 
- Moved some stuff and other small stuff

New in 1.9
----------
- Waiting dcc connections ping out earlier that active ones (define 
  DCC_IDLETIMEOUT and DCC_WAITTIMEOUT for this)
- Help has been rewritten
- Added a small utility to read help without starting the bot
- DCC support for zircon (actually, I rewrote the select-stuff. Now it 
  works with zircon)
- Added internal channel, ban and userlists. Now it's possible to mass* 
  in a fast way, unban users, open channels and use a single nick to 
  register someone (see nwhois, nuseradd, nshitadd, nprotadd, open, 
  massunban etc)
- Mode changes are registred (use !showusers/!showusers #channel and !channels)
- Added a signalhandler. Usefull to see why your bot died (err.log)
- Bot now restarts in a proper way after a kill/server shutdown
- Serverlist has been added. This hasn't really been tested (kinda difficult),
  but whenever a server goes down, the bot should reconnect to another server.
  In the serverfiles, each line should contains the servername and an optional
  portnumber
- Useless, non working commands like fork, random and spy have been removed.
- -b switch added (run in background)
- !files now supports a parameter. !files topic will show INDEX.topic.
- Some bugs fixed (giveop, 372, !send while dcc chat)
- Added DCC_MAXFILESIZE to prevent ppl from sending huge files

future plans:
-------------
- Add configurationfile (that overrides config.h)
- Much more...

Bugs:
-----
No checking with dcc (you can let the bot make a connection to any host/portnumber). 
Please let me know is you find any.

Installation:
-------------
Unpack the tarfile. Edit the config.h file and change default server, channel and nick.
VERY IMPORTANT! choose the right directory for FILEROOTDIR. With the current 
implementation, any file in FILEROOTDIR can be accessed AND uploaded! Make
it point to some tmpdirectory!

VladBot has been comiled succesfully on SunOs 4.1.2, Ultrix and Linux 0.99pl13
If you port this thingy to some other OS, I'd be interested in hearing what
you had to change etc.

History:
--------
VladBot was originally based on HopBot but has changed so much, there is hardly
any resemblance left. For DCC and other things, I took parts from the ircII 2.2.9
client. This is (also) why VladBot is released under the GNU Copyright.
