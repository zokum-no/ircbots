###Installation guide for HOFbot by Fans, modified by HOF.


Part I Installation:
       HOFBot is easy to install but required some patient. If you haven't 
   read the README file yet, please do so!  YOU WON'T MAXIMIZE THE POWER AND 
   FUN OF THE HOFBOT IF YOU DON'T READ THE DOCS. Now, follow the as easy as
   1-2-tree step by step instructions below and make sure you also read the
   Q&A in part II.

1. Edit the hofbot.set to your taste. E.G. onwer host, bot nick, channel name,
      channel setting, command charater, servers...

2. Edit hofbot.userlist, put all users' hosts and levellike this:
      <channel or *> <user nick or host> <user level> <aop> <prot level> 
      <greet level> <password>
      Then rename the hofbot.userlist to <your bot's nick>.userlist

3. You can also edit greet.bot to your taste too. So you can give your irc 
      friend different greet when they join the channel. E.G. "Hi, my master lamer,
      I am ready for your commands.", etc. Also you can edit quotes.bot for 
      the bot's random topic, and edit nicks.bot for it's nicks changing.

4. You now can begin to compile the bot by typing "compile" and wait for a few
      minutes.

4. After all, type "hofbot".  I advice you to try out the commands
      in order to get yourself familiar to the bot.


5. Type "help" on irc to get help.  Also you can read the hofbot.help for all
      commands and NEWCOMMANDS for new HOFbot commands.


Part II. Q&A

1. My bot keep saying incorrect levels?
   	Make sure if your owner host in hofbot.set is correct. 
   Owner=*!*<userid>@*userhost  ex: Owner=*!*jpoon@*sunysb.edu

2. My bot doesn't op my friends?
         Make sure your friend in the bot's userlist. If you assigned
   pass-word for your friend, they have to /msg <botnick> <prefix>auth <passwd>
   After authorized, they can use the bot.

3. Why my bot won't auto op me instantly?
         To avoid too many mode changes in the channel, HOFBot add the delay 
   op feature that the bot will op you only and if only you hasn't be opped 
   by others after 1 minute.  

4. My bot doesn't do greet to me or other users?
         Check the greet.bot and the userlist. The greetlevel is from 1 to 99.
   level 0 is no greet. So make sure the setting is right.

5. My bot keep changing the random topic, but not the topic in my hofbot.set?
   	You must add a ";" after the topic!  Also, u have to trun on the 
   enforce topic option by either set the EnfTop = 1 in the hofbot.set or use 
   the "TogEnfTop" command.

6. My bot doesn't do the nick changing?
         Edit the nicks.bot file, add some different nicks for the bots.
   Also you can use the command "SetNick" for the nick changing time.
