Part I. Legend
*+-+*+-+*+-+*+-
>>Hackbot is a powerful irc robot written by ComStud in C language. Besides
  its powerful channel guarding abilities, It is not prone to flood and pretty
  stable once you loaded it up.
>>HOFbot is based on Hackbot.  Most bugs from Hackbot have been fixed and many
  enhancements are added to MAXIMIZE its power and fun.
>>This official HOFbot comes with all the source codes.  You can modify the
  codes if you want. However, please do give me some credits if you appreciate
  my hard work. :) Once again, i can only promise you that there are absolutely
  no back doors if and only if you get the bot directly from bot(s) in #hof on
  irc or via URL http://www.ug.cs.sunysb.edu/~poonj/hofbot.html

Part II. New Features (See also NEWCOMMANDS)
*+-+*+-+*+-+*+-+*+-+*+-+*+-+*+-+*+-+*+-+*+-+
####################
### HOFbotv2.0B  ###
### Jun 29, 1996 ###
####################
NEW FEATURES:
     1. DCC Partyline (will be enhanced in Final version)
	@ Virtual lag free channel for everyone
	@ Link hofbots together. HOFbotnet in future?
        @ Flood
     To check out this new partyline feature, type joinparty to get
     in then /msg =botnick .helpme
     all commands in partyline needs the . prefix.
	     ex: /msg =botinick .ping  to ping the bot
     To control all the linked bots, use the + prefix.
	     ex: /msg =botinick +ping  to ping ALL the bots
     Things without the prefix will send to all users on the partyline.
	     ex: /msg =botnick hello all
                 and all the users on partyline will see:
		 <someone@botnick> hello all
     2. You can specify prot number for each server in hofbot.set
     3. WarOnTog is added in hofbot.set
     4. Random nick
     5. Random greet - No more annoying greet everytime u join the channel
		       the chance of getting a greet is now 1/10!
     6. Better channel flood protection
   NEW hofbot.set NEW config.h NEW hof-dccparty.c NEW hof-commands.c
   You HAVE TO make changes in the new hofbot.set and config.h
   See FLOODCOUNT and CLONECOUNT in config.h for more info.
   MORE THAN 10 NEW COMMANDS ARE ADDDED! See NEWCOMMANDS for more info.

FIXED BUGS:
     1. A memory leak found in channel.c
     2. check_clonebots truely works now
     3. some bad codes and small bugs have been removed

BUGS:
     1. The bot is unable to establish dcc connections after the bot has
	been loaded up a few days.
     2. Can't link bots in a circle: 
	If A-B and B-C, A-C will creat a lot of problems. (- => is linked to)
####################
### HOFbotv1.03F ###
### Feb. 3, 1996 ###
####################
1.  Able to detect and log most net splits in netsplit.log.
2.  Change nick when net split is detected.
3.  Can call all hofbot in public.  This is very useful if there are several
    hofbots in a channel.  For example:
    there are three hofbots in #hofbot
	hofbot1 with command prefix !
        hofbot2 with command prefix @
        hofbot3 with command prefix #
    instead of typing !ping, @ping and #ping to command those bots, you just
    have to type: hofbot ping
4.  TogWarOn is added! Don't get it wrong.  It's not an offensive war 
    toggle.  It's an extremely defensive toggle that protects your channel.
    When WARON toggle is on, the bot will ignore all ctcp, private, and public
    messages that are done by non-users(0 accesss level). This is a very secure
    way to ignore floods and thus stabilize the bot.  In addition, it will make
    the bot respond much quickly.  The only disadvantage is that the bot won't 
    kick people that are flooding in public.
5.  Use three link lists for nicks, greets, and delayop.  They are more 
    efficient than reading data from nicks.bot, greets.bot, and .delay.
6.  No longer need to put a ";" after the awaymsg and topic in hofbot.set.  
####################
### HOFbotv1.03B ###
### Jan. 3, 1996 ###
####################
1.  Fixed functions changenick(), read_nickfiles(), changetopic(), addgreet()
    ... to make the bot work better and nicer. :)
2.  Command.log and msg.log are added.  User can just /msg botnick <text> to
    leave a msg in the msg.log.
    Hint: Delete the log files once a week to save hard disk space.
3.  Better upload interface!  Added information about the files for
    downloading.  See upload/HOFbot.filelist for details.
4.  Cycle the channel automatically when it is the only one in the
    channel and has no op status(steal mode).
5.  When it joins a channel, it will:
    - Make itself invisible.
    - Set the topic in hofbot.set for that channel.
    - Set the modes in hofbot.set for that channel.
6.  Set away itself if setaway msg is given in hofbot.set.
    a) SETAWAY command is added.
7.  HOFbot use the command levels in hofbot.levels instead of hof-ons.c.
    a) SAVELEVELS command is added to let you save new command levels in
       hofbot.levels.
    Note: CHACCESS(hackbot command) will let you change a command level.
8.  FL, FPL, MAL, MPL, ... can be found in hofbot.set now. ;)
9.  CGREETLVL command is added.  Finally, you can change user's greet level
    in a snap.  A must check out kewl command!
10. DelayOpTog and RanQuoteTog are added to hofbot.set.
    a) TOGDELAYOP command is added.
    b) TOGRANQUOTE command is added.
    c) SETRANQUOTE command is added.
11. Fresh ADD, USERLIST, and STATS command.
12. Uh...there are some more changes but i really can't remember.  Oh well,
    i hope they are not important. :)
######################
### HOFbotv1.02P   ###
### Sept. 16, 1995 ###
######################
1.  The SIGSERV - Trying to reboot is fixed.  HOFBot reloads
     itself when a memory conflict occures.
2.  The bot massops or massdeops using "+oooo" or "-oooo"
3.  REFRESH command is added.  Use this command when the
     bot act "strange" or "slow" with no reason.
4.  HOFKEY command is added.
5.  SENDROSE command is added.
6.  ADDGREET command is added.
####################
### HOFbotv1.02  ###
### Aug. 1, 1995 ###
####################
1.  Upload files and download files using dcc.
Setting up files available for download
---------------------------------------
     HOFBot allows users to DCC get files from it that your designate in
"HOFbot.filelist" -- This file must be located in the upload directory set
in the hofbot.set file.  The HOFbot.filelist is displayed with the command
"files".  So users will know which ones they can download.  Here's the format
of the file:

<Filename> <Accesslvl to get the file>

     All the files must be located in the upload directory.
Note: each file must be on a new line in HOFbot.filelist
Also, there should be an example in /upload.

2.  Enforce topic.  The bot will enforce the topic after a specific time
    interval.  Two options: 1. enftop for short and "colorful" topic =)
			    2. enftop2 for long and boring topic :O
3.  Delayopppppppppppppppppppppp!  For the sake of ppl in the channel, the
    bot will not op users or bots that are opped by others. It continues to
    do other things and give op IF AND ONLY IF the users or bots haven't
    been opped after 1 minute.
    so no more ***Mode change "+o lamer" on channel #lame by lamer2
	       ***Mode change "+o lamer" on channel #lame by lamer3
####################
### HOFbotv.101  ###
### July 1, 1995 ###
####################
1. Change nick right after a Kill, nick collision or changed servers.
2. Change nick during a specified time interval.
3. Set a random topic according to the one millionth customer or the tenth
   millionth or whatever you prefer. :)
4. It greets ppl according to different greet levels. See the greets.bot for
   more details.
5. Word kick toggle. If word kick is enabled, it will kick-ban the lamer after
   he/she has cursed in public three times.  The kick words are fuck, dick, or
   pussy.
6. News of the day!  It will send your news to all of its channels.
   (I'm thinking about to make the bot show the news to user who just join the
    channel(s) if news toggle is turn on in the future.)
7. It will send a heart, poem, or song to some one u like upon request. ;)
