Compiling?
~~~~~~~~~~
To compile the source:

1) Uncompress the source code distribution archive.

2) cd emech-2.9.1
-- Since you are reading this file, you have most likely already
   come to this point.

3) ./configure
-- This script will prompt you for features to include or exclude,
   going with the default isnt a bad idea.

4) make clean install

If all went well you should now have an executable called ``mech''.

---*---

Setup?
~~~~~~
Read  the  sample.set  file to  get  an idea of  the  config  file
commands and then try to make your own.  A basic setup doesnt need
much more than NICK,  USERFILE,  CHANNEL and  SERVER entries,  the
rest is just tweaks of default values.

EnergyMech no longer has a setup mode.  Before running the bot you
should run ./genuser <userfile>.  For example, if your USERFILE is
emech.users, you should run `./genuser emech.users'.

Quick steps:

1) cp sample.set mech.set

2) pico mech.set 
-- replace ''pico'' with your favourite text editor,  look through 
   the file for sections to change,  you will have to remove lines
   in order to get the bot to work. Check the file completely!

3) ./genuser

4) ./mech 

That should get you running. If you don't see your bot come on IRC
after a few minutes,  you should try running the bot in debug mode
to see what's going on with... 

  ./mech -d 

If you get an 'Unknown option -d', you need to answer 'Y' to debug
support when running ./configure from the compiling section above.

Updated Files?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main distro-site for the Energymech is:

 http://www.energymech.net/index.html

You can also find the files on ftp at:

 ftp://ftp.energymech.net/pub/energymech/

 You can also run the `cvsupdate'  program,  which will fetch the
 latest version directly from our CVS server.

More Help?
~~~~~~~~~~
You  could try  asking for  help on  the undernet  channel #emech.
However,  try reading the documentation  before asking there since
we arent really fond of answering trivial questions.

The  channel  #emech is  more a  place for  people  who  like  the
EnergyMech,  not a help-channel,  so dont expect to  get help from
the people there. And if you *do* get help, be grateful for it.

We will NOT teach  you how to work with UNIX  shells or how to use
your mech, you have to learn that by yourself. Im noting this here
since it seems to be a common misconception that we would.

In short:

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS IS. YOU ARE ENTIRELY ON YOUR OWN WHEN
IT COMES TO CONFIGURING AND USING IT.

Bug Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~

Bugs  can be  reported in  #emech  on  undernet,  or by  email  to
<mailto:emech-dev@energymech.net>. This is an open mailing-list so
you may not receive a reply  unless you subscribe  (see EnergyMech
