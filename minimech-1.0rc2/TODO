 */

 - Intra-process userfile sharing and synchronization
 - Inter-process userfile sharing and synchronization
 - More testing on 64bit systems (OSF/1, Tru64, Alpha-Linux, SunOS 64bit?, IRIX64?)
 - Genuine telnet protocol support for telnet sessions
 - Built in nslookup and finger (Is this a wanted/used feature?)
 - SOCKS4/5 support
 - Automatic +l updating (should be (a) setting(s))
 - Undernet CService support
   (should be channel settings (set=password, tog=enable/disable) /proton)
 - DalNet Nickserv/Chanserv support
   (needed? they dont tolerate much bots on that network /proton)
 - Update/complete the mech.help file.
 - Mode +/-o commands to check for SO and if SO is set, check
   userlevel and make sure user has access before sending MODEs.
 - Multiple channels per userrecord.
 - SET REGAIN for quicker nick regain control.
   (Personally I dont agree with this one /proton)
 - Make it possible to pipe SPY through another bot.
   Ex: bots = laurel, hardy; /msg laurel -spy #emech hardy!#emech
 - Add file transfer capabilities (DCC/ftp/whatever).
 - ALIAS command to add/remove aliases at runtime.

/*
 *  Most of these features are open for discussion on how to
 *  (or even if) implement them
 *
 *  Patches are most welcome
