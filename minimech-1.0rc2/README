Compiling?
~~~~~~~~~~
To compile the source:

1) Uncompress the source code distribution archive.

2) cd minimech-1.0rc2
-- Since you are reading this file, you have most likely already
   come to this point.

3) ./configure
-- This script will prompt you for features to include or exclude,
   going with the default isnt a bad idea.

4) make clean install

If all went well you should now have an executable called ``mech''.

Setup?
~~~~~~
Read  the  sample.set  file to  get  an idea of  the  config  file
commands and then try to make your own.  A basic setup doesnt need
much more than NICK,  USERFILE,  CHANNEL and  SERVER entries,  the
rest is just tweaks of default values.

Once you get your  mech online,  it will be running in setup mode.
As long  as the  mech remains  in setup mode,  everyone will  have
superuser access to it.  To get it out  of setup mode,  simply use
the command ``ADD'' to add yourself to its userlist. Make sure you
add yourself at  superuser level (100)  with access to all (``*'')
channels. See ``HELP ADD'' for more help about the ADD command.

An example:
  -add spiffy * *!*spiffy@*dialup.dot.com 100 0 0 mysecretpassword

More Help?
~~~~~~~~~~
You  could try  asking for  help on  the undernet  channel #emech.
However,  try reading the documentation  before asking there since
we arent really fond of answering trivial questions.

The  channel  #emech is  more a  place for  people  who  like  the
MiniMech, not a help-channel,  so dont expect to get help from the
people there. And if you *do* get help, be grateful for it.

We will NOT teach  you how to work with UNIX  shells or how to use
your mech, you have to learn that by yourself. Im noting this here
since it seems to be a common misconception that we would.

In short:

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS IS. YOU ARE ENTIRELY ON YOUR OWN WHEN
IT COMES TO CONFIGURING AND USING IT.
