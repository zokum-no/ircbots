# ircbots
A comprehensive collection of classic IRC bots, mostly from the Vladbot family.
Many of these bots were written in a time where cpu and memory was quite 
expensive and having a scripting engine or inefficient code would be very
detrimental. Version control systems, public repositories and pre-packaged bots
delivered as part of an operating system were rare.

People downloaded source code, forked it to suit their needs and there are most
likely many mods, rewrites and other changes that are lost to time.

In some cases forks were done and each fork incorporated all wanted changes 
from the original code bases. Putting new changes in a separate file made it
easier to update and merge source code. This is most likely whye the incubot
has a vlad-ons, crc-ons, mega-ons, tbt-ons and crc-ons source code files. The
code is the original bot and the work of four other forks / coders.

Many of the bots would rename the files and often remove documentation and 
credits. This could be to give an impression of having developed all the code
themselves, but it could also have been a way to avoid the original developers
receiving bug reports and help requests for code they did not write or have
access to.

I started using Incubots in 2000-2001 and have been using a fork of this bot
since then. In 2023 I started digging into the history of the bot and went
looking for forks of the bot. I found a lot more than I had expected. It was
a big surprise to me that the well-known Energy Mech bot was from the Vladbot
family.

## Vladbot family tree
After some research, this is the known family tree for the Vladbot family of irc

## Credits
Many of the forks removed the credits to earlier authors, giving an incomplete
view of who did what. All of the bots should credit 'Coyote Peyote' and all but
the two earliest should credit Ivo and the rest of the Vladbot team.
