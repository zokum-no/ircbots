  TnT-II bot ChangeLog -- Update info
  by: ttone (tonys@access.mountain.net)
=========================================

Version 5.7f ----------------------------------------------------
   o	Now should track a logged in user's nickname better.  This would
	not necessitate the logged in user to re-auth to the bot after
	having authorized to the bot followed by changing his/her nickname.
   o	The bot will not automatically change its nickname until 4 minutes 
	after it has last joined a channel, under calm periods.
	- BUT for nick change upon being kicked, the bot won't change its
	  nick until 30 seconds after it has last joined a channel.
   o	The bot should behave better in ONUL (op non-user level) protection.
   o	Added "ver" command that allows the bot to show to bot users
	the version (release and compile date) of the bot.
   o	UPDATE: The ignore function will ignore private messages, public 
	messages, notices, and ctcps (requests and replies) from the 
	ignored user.
   o	Now made the forked bots have the same general settings of their
	parent(s), e.g. the various flood detection and protection settings,
	the spite interval, the min. DCC level, the AOP level, etc.
   o	Fixed bot dying from malformed user@host settings for USER.ADD
	and AK.ADD.
   o	Command parsing has changed such that only lines that begin
	with a non-space character are ok.
	- Also, fixed the parsing of commands that go to specific botnick.
	  Commands issued to bot nicks that don't start with an upper or 
	  lower-case letter can now be parsed correctly again.
   o	Added configuration setting command MaxLagAllowed, in seconds.
	This command sets the maximum lag, the bot will tolerate from
	the server before it switches to another server.
	- Added corresponding online bot setting command BS.MLA.
   o	Added configuration setting command MaxAutoOpDelay, in seconds.
	This command sets the maximum duration the bot will wait before
	giving out delayed auto-ops.
	- Added corresponding online bot setting command BS.MAD.
   o	Improved netsplit detection.
   o	Added SHOW.AOP subcommand to list the auto-opped users.
   o	Fixed bot process from dying by segmentation violation if bot exits
	from too many server reconnects.
   o	Added '*' option to RESYNC command, as in "RESYNC *", to allow the
	bot send out JOIN requests for all channels it's supposed to be in.
   o	Modified delayed auto-ops to delay 5-10 seconds for non-lagged server
	connections and 10-20 seconds for server connections with at least
	6 seconds of lag time.
   o	Added modification to stop the bot from always trying to connect to 
	servers that has already banned it.  It'll retry 1 in 10 times.
   o	Changed processing of some actions on op after all modes are parsed.
   o	Now hides the arguments to the PASSWD and LIN commands from users
	who are spying commands.
   o	Preliminary change: now queues the kicks due to channel user
	flooding from public msgs, beeps, and shouting (caps).
   o	To unban an user being auto-kicked, prefix the nickname with the
	exclamation mark, '!'.
   o	Renamed the following bot online setting commands:
	- BS.MDL-->BS.MDT; BS.MKL-->BS.MKT; BS.NCL-->BS.NFT;
	  BS.BKL-->BS.BKT; BS.CKL-->BS.CKT;
   o	Added KickQCheckInterval bot configuration setting command to
	set the interval in seconds between checking the kick queues.
   o	New commands for toggling the multi-nick kicks:
	- Added bot configuration toggle command "MultiNickKick".
	- Added corresponding online toggle BT.MNK.
   o	Added the minimum and maximum values for the configuration setting
	commands for reference.  Use the command SAVE.CFGCMDS to save the 
	config commands reference to the file "config.cmds".
   o	Fixed the bot secure so one -can- set the secured access indefinitely.
	- Also fixed CMA command not to change the secure length if that is
	  longer than the cma length.
   o	BS.ONUL (op non-user level) can now be set to level 1000 if need be.
   o	The bot will now only update the topic if it's opped in the channel.
   o	New configuration settings commands: NOSERVEROP2 channel toggle,
	and SECURELEVEL and SECURELENGTH bot settings.
   o	Owners (access = 999) can secure the bot to 1000 if needed.
	Users with access of 999 can still lower the security level when needed.
   o	Added GS.DITO subcommand for setting the Dcc Idle Timeout value.
	- Set to -1 to disable automatic timeout.
   o	Added GS.MEML and GS.AUTL online setting commands for setting the
	memory and authorization lifetimes.  They are in minutes.
   o	Added NONBLOCKCONNECT configuration setting command for determining
	whether network connect attempts should be non-blocking.
   o	Now properly reads in nicknames and channel names.
	- If any of them are not legal, the bot will exit immediately.
   o	Added fix to hopefully reduce the bot from potential flooding
	due to sending mode changes.
   o	Added subcommands CMD, -CMD, and NLIST to the SPY command
	for dealing with the spying of bot commands.
	- Also renamed NOMSG subcommand to -MSG.
   o	Added deop of unknown ops on detection of massdeops and masskicks
	if the bot is in CMA mode.
   o	Added change such that known ops massdeoping and masskicking
   	non-bot users (e.g. clones/flooders) will not be punished.
   o	Added BOTS subcommand to GLOBAL to quickly list all bots online.
   o	Updated BT and CT commands to accept an additional parameter of
	"on" or "off" to turn on/off the toggle.
   o	Renamed the command NEWBOT to FORK.  This is used to quickly
	setup another bot with the parent bot's attributes.
   o	Fixed general CTCP (unknown) commands parsing.
   o	Removed more confirmation replies for executing some commands.
   o	Fixed CTCP PING reply.
   o	For now, only commands sent through DCC chat can have the
	"Executing command..." confirmation reply .
   o	Fixed the IGN(ore) command such that it sets the masks better.
   o	Fixed registration request to irc server.
   o	Preliminary proxy server support.  Use the global configuration
	setting command "Firewall".
   o	Added global configuration setting commands "NickFloodMask",
	"BeepFloodMask", and "PubFloodMask" for determining the 
	nick!user@host mask for the various flood offenders.
   o	Added "LeaveRestricted" bot toggle configuration command along
	with the BT.LRS (leave restricted server) bot toggle for
	allowing the bot to leave a restricted server when it 
	encounters one.
   o	Added "BotHostName" and "BotIpAddress" global configuration
   	settings to specify the particular hostname or ip address 
   	to use for network connections.  Work still in progress.
   o	Fixed the swapped autokick message for public and ctcp flooders. 
   o	The toggle "change nick on kick" (BT.CNK) is no longer affected by
	the CMA mode.  Before, even if CNK toggle is off but CMA mode
	is on, the bot will change nick upon being kicked.
   o	Now restricts sending of kicks and nick changes on a
	restricted connection (+r).
   o	Changed delayed auto-op slightly to deop the nick if that 
	nick quits irc before the auto-op is given.
   o	Restricted server connections will now be noted for any bots.
   o	Fixed the ban pattern when usernames are 10 (!) chars in length.
   o	The SERV command should now be able to switch to a (new) server
	with its specified port number.
   o	Added "FloodProtLevel" bot configuration setting command for
	setting the channel protection when detecting any floods
	- Valid levels are 0 (none), 1 (kick), and 2 (kick+ban).
   o	Added "CMALength" bot configuration setting command for setting
	the time in minutes the bot should be in channel minded mode.
	- Set to -1 for always on.
   o	Now works with irc 2.9 server's JOIN and PART formats.
   o	To try to op or deop users even when the bot thinks it is not
	opped, use the exclamation mark '!' in front of the first nick.
	- e.g.  use "op !ThatNick" to force the bot send out an op mode for
	  nick "ThatNick".
   o	Fixed the bot process from dying if one of the multiple bots 
	configured for the bot process is issued to DIE.
   o	Added the count of split users in the CHI display, denoted by SPLT.
   o	Consolidated the logs for "onme", "onthem", and "kickban" into
	the log "actions".  The individual toggles are unchanged.
	- Changed SHOW.LOG command accordingly.
   o	Updated to parse favorably TSora server-set +ov channel nick mode.
	- (why even bother with "+ov" channel modes for nick??)
   o	Removed server info gathering related toggles
	- "ServerInfo" bot toggle configuration command is gone.
	- "BT SI" is now gone.
   o	The BotDir setting is now the relative root for all 
	non-configurable botfiles.
	- This means that one is better off starting the bot from
	  the bot directory and setting BotDir to "./"
	  - This allows the bot to read the startup config file
	    during a bot refresh.
	- Logfiles are now written to this relative bot directory.
	  They were written to the directory where the bot got 
	  launched from such that if BotDir setting is not the 
	  launch directory, "SHOW LOG ..." will report nothing.
	  - Also removed extra blank line from the SHOW LOG output.
   o	Logfile timestamping changed to: YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss
   o	Added global configuration command "AutoStrictOpLen" (ASO) for
	setting the number of minutes the bot will be on strict-op
	automatically after some channel action.
	- If the bot is in ASO mode, delayed auto-opping will be bypassed
	  in favor or immediate auto-op.
   o	The bot now kicks once every second for users that should be
	auto-kicked upon joining the bot's channel.
	- This delayed kicking is also used in the masskicking feature.
   o	Fixed memory leak in greeting list if the bot is rehashed.

Version 5.7e ----------------------------------------------------
   o	If a channel has public commands disabled, then commands for
	that channel can only be issued through private messages.
	- This means commands issued in public prefixed with either
	  the prefix character or prefix word will not be carried out.
   o	Re-added AUTODEBAN channel toggle command.  This allows whether
	the bot will automatically expire bans in the channel specified.
	- Also re-added CT.ADB channel toggle subcommand.
   o	Fixed a bug in LOG.CHAT.LIST subcommand.
   o	The REPORT command now also shows the subcommands invoked by users.
   o	Changed to delay channel who request after a channel join.

Version 5.7d ----------------------------------------------------
   o	Fixed the SIGSEGV bug from signoff messages.
   o	Now allows AuthLifeTime to be shorter than MemoryLifeTime, given
	that MemoryLifeTime is at least 5 minutes.

Version 5.7c ----------------------------------------------------
   o	Fixed FreeBSD version with respect to crypted passwords.
	- Now uses crypt.c source originally by Tom Truscott.
	- The previous FreeBSD versions were compiled with crypt() from
	  the libscrypt.so (07/16/96, v2.0) library, which didn't really
	  provide backward compatibility with the (old) crypt() function
	  on the other platforms.
   o	Enhanced SERV command.  If the entered server is non-reachable,
	the bot won't terminate the current server's connection.
	- Added '+' prefix -- prefixing a server with the '+', plus, sign
	  allows you to add that server in without causing a server change.
   o	Fixed clustering of DNS hostnames that start with a number. (ARGH!)
	- This will allow "USER ADD <nick>" to add a reasonable hostmask.
   o	Passwords less than 5 characters long entered in "tnt2 -u" will
	cause the password access for the request hostmask to be unset!
	- This allows the resetting of user passwords :)
   o	Fixed the useradd feature when invoking the bot as "tnt2 -u"
	or "tnt2 -m"; it now accepts user input properly and more consistently.
   o	The bot now sends the "Enter your password:" prompt as it should
	if you have password access on the bot and attempt to initiate a 
	DCC chat connection with it.
   o	Fixed the Ping Timeout problem.
   o	Most network connect calls are blocking I/O initially, then set
	to nonblocking I/O after successful connect.
	- This should fix the previous two problems.
   o	PASSWD.UNSET works properly now.  For those with problems in logging
	in after a PASSWD UNSET, try the password "NP".
   o	Added MEMORYLIFETIME and AUTHLIFETIME global setting commands for
	setting the expire time for idle users in the memory list.
	- MemoryLifeTime sets the time non-bot users remain in memory, 
	  from 2 to 7200 minutes.
	- AuthLifeTime sets the time password-protected users remain in memory
	  after they have logged in to the bot, from 4 to 7200 minutes.

Version 5.7b ----------------------------------------------------
   o	The bot should be more regular about backing up the user and autokick
	lists after midnight when the bot is online.
   o	Fixed memory leak in backup_files from 5.7a.
   o	Now it's possible to spy on ALL channels by using "*" as the channel,
	i.e. SPY ADD *
	- Note that using "*" will cause the other channels to be deleted
	  from the channel spy list.
   o	Fixed a bug in seconds to idle conversion, e.g. idle x days y min...
	- Before, if the hours came out to be 0, no matter how many days
	  the bot is up or idle, the display will only tell you the 
	  idle/uptime being so many minutes and so many seconds.  Oops!

Version 5.7a ----------------------------------------------------
   o	Fixed SERV command's delete option.  One can now delete
	a server from the bot's server list either by "server:port"
	or by the index to the left of the server.
   o	Added ".list" option to SERV command -- it works the same as for
	the SHOW SERVERS command.
   o	Idle memory list entries are kept for ~25 minutes; idle logged in
	(non-DCC) users in the memory list are logged out after 35 minutes.
   o	Improved netsplit/netjoin detection.
	- Flood detection for netjoin channel users will be slightly
	  more lenient by approx. 5 units:
	  - Public messages flood level is increased by 5 lines.
	  - Beep check flood level is increased by 5 counts.
	  - Nick flood level is increased by 3 nicks.
	- This change could possibly make life better just right after
	  a netjoin.
	- Netjoin flood check levels are reverted to the normal levels
	  after upwards to a minute (slow netjoins are another matter).
   o	Enabled the viewing of IrcII /WHOIS and /USERHOST information 
	if so requested.

Version 5.7 -----------------------------------------------------
   o	Changed the options '-u' and '-m' to invoke a generic
	built-in userlist maintenance function.
	- It's possible to add/delete users.
	- You can modify these user profiles: 
          - nick, password, access, auto-op, and channel(s)
   o	Fixed the error reply when the bot needs a longer pattern for
	certain commands.
   o	Fixed the join of an existing channel with a key set after the bot 
	starts up and connects to a server.  Before, it couldn't join
	the already established channel that has a channel key.
   o	Changed ctcp replies a bit.  Also added CTCP USERINFO response.
	- Ctcp userinfo response can be configured in the config file
	  with the global setting command of "UserInfo".
   o	Changed the default anti-idle time to a saner maximum limit.
	- 3 hours is a bit extended.
   o	It's now possible to change certain CTCP responses online: 
	finger (GS CFM), userinfo (GS CIM), version (GS CVM), and 
	clientinfo (GS CCM).
   o	Updated/added the correct GS options to the SGS command.
   o	Fixed "GS MKI" setting.  It was doing the same thing as "GS MDI".
   o	Removed "GS STMS" for setting the select() timeout in microseconds.
        - Timeouts will now be in integer seconds only.
   o	Removed "AUTODEBANINTERVAL" channel setting command.  The bot
	will now remove expired bans approx. every 5 min.
   o	Added netsplit information for channel users who got netsplitted.
	- Netsplit users will be denoted as such from WHO and WHOS displays.
	- Users who are not back within about 15 minutes are purged
 	  from the channel userlist.
	- The purge will be done approx. every 10 minutes.
	- Netsplit detection is improved even more to check for valid
	  domains.
   o	Hopefully fixed the obscure bug with the bot sending out the reply
	to the last command you requested before you are asked for your
	password while logging in to the bot (via DCC CHAT).
   o	Timer auto-kicking will elicit a ban on the third join attempt.
   o	The file "configcmds.lst" is now renamed to "config.cmds".
   o	"UserName" command is not used by default.  The bot can and will
	determine the login of the user invoking the bot.

Version 5.6k ----------------------------------------------------
   o	Added detection of CTCP Flood to a channel and to the bot.
	- If the flood is to the channel and the abuser is not protected 
	  at level 2 or higher, the bot will kick the abuser if the flood
	  protection mode is set at 1.
	- A ban may also be placed if the flood protection mode (BS.FPL)
	  is set to level 2.
	- Request floods to the bot will be ignored -- no replies are sent.
   o	Changed the number of possible channels configured in infile.cfg
	to 10, the max. allowed by some servers.
   o	Fixed server read of join's; sometimes a trailing character gets
	left in the channel name.
	- This should fix the problem with the bot not banning some user
	  on timer autokick who repeatedly rejoins the channel.
   o	Changed the output format for some commands, e.g. WHO, WHOS...
   o	AWAY command now works through DCC CHAT to set the bot's own away
	message if the user is not on the party line.

Version 5.6j ----------------------------------------------------
   o	Fixed commands that need to obtain the user@host when only given 
	the nicknames; e.g. USER ADD <nickname>..., USER DEL <nickname>...
   o	Changed auto-DCC CHAT request so that the bot will only auto-request
	(if toggled on) DCC CHAT of users whose access is at least MinDCCLevel.
	- one side-effect for this is if MinDCCLevel is set too high, users
	  able to request a command that requires DCC CHAT won't be able
	  to use that command. :-I
   o	The CHAT command will only work for those users whose accesses are
	at least MinDCCLevel.
   o	Max. nickname length is set to 30 chars. for those daring to run
	bots on DALnet, but registered nicks are highly recommended to stay at
	max. of 9 chars. in length.
   o	Renamed STEAL to REGAIN; renamed NSTEAL to FORGET. 
	- REGAIN can only be used for those channels that were configured
	  in the config. file.
	- Note: the maximum number of configured channels allowed per bot is 5.
   o	Fixed the nickname in party line action so that it will be in accord
	with the nick you've changed to.
   o	Fixed commands sent through DCC chat; bot will sometimes think the
	command is a comment.
   o	Max. number of concurrent DCC sessions (chat, send) is set to 45.
   o	Changed so that if user deops oneself, the bot won't reop the user.
   o	Party line nickname is as registered in the users file.  If user is
	not registered, the nick will be the one user is presently using
	and randomized if it's not unique to the party line.
	- This means that when users are added, make sure their registered
	  nicknames are unique per user.
   o	The bot will now invite users who are kicked and are protected
	at level 2 or higher, unless the bot did the kicking.
   o	Fixed active server info gathering (BT SI) for users joining channel.
	- useful mainly for channels with people joining occasionally 
   o	Revised spy functions that will only allow users on DCC CHAT to spy.
	- any spying *requires* DCC connection.
	- one can no longer specify another target to spy for.
   o	The output for "Enforced modes" from SCS command with the default
	current channel is displayed fine now.

Version 5.6i ----------------------------------------------------
   o	Fixed the occasional yet serious dropping of a line after 
	having concatenated a message (from 5.6h).
   o	Fixed user count after RESYNC of a channel.
   o	Fixed furious empty socket reads after certain dcc chat close
	situations initiated by the DCC user -- since 5.x (maybe even earlier)
	- the reads would drop back to normal when another dcc chat is 
	  established.
   o	DCC party line commands are now the following (MUST be sent thru DCC):
	[NOTE: these DCC-only commands can be used by anyone with DCC link.]
	- .CHAT ON  -- to join party line when entered thru DCC CHAT
	- .CHAT OFF -- to get off party line w/o closing DCC link
	- .MOTD     -- to display DCC party line Message Of The Day
	- .QUIT     -- to close dcc link, hence getting off party line
	- .ME       -- to send an action to the party line, must be issued
	               through DCC CHAT (formerly PME)
	- .ECHO     -- to turn on/off echoing of messages sent from self,
	               options are "on" and "off" (formerly PECHO)
	- .WHOM     -- used to list who are on the party line (formerly PWHO)
	- .NICK     -- change own nick in the party line
	- .AWAY     -- set/unset away message in party line
   o	The command "SAVE CMDREF" will also save the available DCC-only cmds.
   o	Dcc party line flood detection is now treated the same as regular
	server private messages.
   o	CTCP replies can be spied appropriately (not that the bot will send
	out CTCP requests in the first place).
   o	Changed WAR command to CMA (Channel-Minded Automaton).
	- when in CMA mode, the bot will no longer greet people and checks
	  for public flooding only.
   o	Default access levels for SAY and MSG commands are now set to 800.
   o	Fixed config toggle settings where the line is like "!Greet   = 1"
   o	Added bot toggle "BT LPM" -- Log Private Messages -- allows the bot to
	log private messages sent to it.
	- Also added config. bot toggle command LogPrivMsg.
   o	Message spying now includes the sender's user@host as well, in the
	form of *nick!user@host* -- more informative in the log if BT.LPM is on.
   o	Incorporated ADDUSER and ADDOWNER into tnt2 binary file 
	- invoke ADDOWNER as "tnt2 -m" and ADDUSER as "tnt2 -u".

Version 5.6h ----------------------------------------------------
   o	Removed silly "Unknown command" error reply because the user
	does not have adequate access to that particular command (from 5.6g).
   o	Spy messages can be sent time-stamped in the form of Hour:Min:Sec
	- time-stamping can be enabled/disabled online with the command
	  "BT AST" (Add Spy Time).
   o	Removed those silly "./" characters that get interspersed with
	the incoming server data (from 5.6g).
	- Removed possible SIGSEGVs caused by this read problem as well.
   o	Attempted to correct total user count in CHI output; incomplete still.
   o	Not yet fixed: "SERV" command must be executed twice if you want to 
	add a server and then use it as well.
	- Be sure the port is specified as well if it's other than 6667
	  when specifying the server to change to.
   o	Hopefully fixed the problem with the bot not knowing that it is
	indeed opped in a channel (from 5.6g).
   o	Removed "UserName" bot setting command; the process will find the
	appropriate login or use "UNKNOWN" (very rare case) otherwise.
   o	Added "AntiIdle" configuration bot toggle command.  Set to 0 to
	disable anti-idle; default is set to true.
	- Also added "BT AI" online bot toggle command.
   o	Fixed "REFRESH" command so that it actually works (bug from long ago).
	- "NEWBOT" and "REBOOT" commands should work once again as well.
   o	Users with access 900 or above can make the bot leave a channel and
	_not_ rejoin even if the auto-rejoin flag is active.
   o	Fixed: "LOAD NICKS" should work fine now.

Version 5.6g ----------------------------------------------------
   o	Finally! Made the bot less CPU intensive.
   o	Fixed CMD.WORD command so it works once again.
   o	Fixed SIGSEGV problem due to sending lots of bytes to DCC connections,
	causing temporary lack of system allotted resources.
   o	Fixed INFO output of used system time. It was inflated by some factor.
   o	Mostly lower-case replies; my eyes needed some rest.
   o	Fixed "%QuoteInterval" channel configuration setting in infile.cfg.
	It was mistakenly set to seconds and not to minutes.
   o	Changed DCC-connect password wait timeout to 2 minutes or so.
   o	Added "MotdFile" global configuration command for setting the
	location and name of the motd file for DCC party line.
   o	Changed Beep and Caps checking so that if the bot is not opped,
	it will no longer perform the two aforementioned checks.
   o	Fixed serious bug in a few GS command options.
   o	Added a tiny bit of security checking for mklog file -- "rm " command
	is not allowed (not that anyone would want to delete something anyway).

Version 5.6f ----------------------------------------------------
   o	Changed GS.PMNAK to GS.PMAK, for Public (flood) Messages to Auto-kick
   o	Changed BT.LOGKB (log kicks and bans) to BT.LKB.
   o	Changes to ".s" versions
	- Fixed file transfer functions.
	- Re-added channel user idle checking.
	- The greeting feature is re-added.
   o	Enhanced the display for outputs from SBT, SCT, SBS, SGS, and SCS
	to display the option that goes with each of the respective set
	commands.
	- any setting that doesn't correspond to any option will have
	  "n/a" as the option.
   o	Renamed command PARTY.DELETE to PARTY.KICK.
	- Added kick message when someone has been kicked off.
   o	Changed the protection levels.  They now mean the following:
	- level 0 -- no protection
	- level 1 -- unban user if user is banned
	- level 2 -- level 1 + reop user if user is deopped
	- level 3 -- levels 1+2 + deop offender is offender is not protected
	- level 4 -- levels 1+2+3 + kick offender
	- level 5 -- levels 1+2+3+4 + ban offender as well

Version 5.6e (BETA BETA BETA) -----------------------------------
   o	NEW! Channel-specific access levels!
	- To add channel specific access, specify channels as
	  #chan1@<level_for_#chan1>,#chan2@<level_for_#chan2>
	- Note the new character '@'
	- Note that "USER ADD" function still requires an access level,
	  but you -can- use the #channel@access construct to specify
	  per channel access level.
   o	Fixed: "AKMOD CHAN" can accept "*" as a channel name.
   o	Fixed: Server hop count should now be registered when doing
	/CTCP <bot> WHO <channel>
   o	Added "KickJustBanned" configuration channel toggle command.
	- Also added online "CT KJB" channel toggle command.
	- This allows automatic kick of everyone matching the banned pattern,
	  unless the user has adequate access level on the bot.
   o	Removed a few old commands:
	- MOP --> use PO instead for massopping
	- MCK --> use PK instead for masskicking
	- MDEOP --> use PD instead for massdeopping
   o	Improved "helpread" utility to print a prompt and ask for topic
	to display help for if no topics are specified.
   o	Added switches "-m" and "-u" to run ADDOWNER and ADDUSER
	programs, respectively.
	- This allows adding of bot owner and users.
   o	CHANGED! Added crypted passwords.  Any passwords not encrypted
	will be encrypted by the bot upon a restart.
   o	Added daily backup of user and autokick lists to filenames with
	"_backup" appended.
   o	Added exit upon too many server connect retries.
	- The value is set at 80 reconnects.
	- (The retry count will be user settable later.)
   o	Removed any spy activities once a user's password interval has expired.
   o	Added password access for DCC CHAT.  If user has password-protected
	access, that user -must- provide the password in order to establish
	dcc connection.
	- Password must be entered within ~60 seconds of establishing
	  a dcc connection to maintain it.
   o	Fixed a bug in USER.CLVL and USER.PROT commands.

Version 5.6d ---------------------------------------------------
   o	Fixed: will not cutoff DCC connection of users with high access.
   o	Fixed: "SERV" command now works properly and also accepts 
	the index of the server to change to.
   o	The delete server command "SERV -<server_name>" now also
	accepts the index of the server for deletion.
   o	Changed to non-blocking I/O -- see if this helps.
   o	Auto-op of users with access to *all* channels now fixed.
   o	USER ADD command now checks for the correct access of the
	target channels with those of the one adding to make sure
	non-accessed channels cannot be added.
	- NOTE: Consider this a beta feature still.
   o	Changed BT.NCK (change nick on kick) to BT.CNK.  Configuration
	bot toggle command remains as before.
   o	Added BT.NFC (nick-flood check) command.  If on, will check
	for nick flooders and kick on the right conditions.
	- Default setting is on.
	- Complementary configuration bot toggle command is NickFloodCheck.
   o	Fixed spying of ctcp messages; the channel was missing.

Version 5.6c ---------------------------------------------------
   o	Fixed the auto-op of users (with auto-op access) who do not 
	even have access to the channel(s) in question.
   o	Fixed "SHOW LOG <logfile>" command so "<logfile>" is in
	lower case.
   o	Fixed "AK ADD" so that _any_ user with access to _any_
	channel could not be added to the autokick list.
   o	Fixed a bug that shows up on the Solaris system with 
	the bot dieing due to use of "USER ADD" command.
    o	Added %AutoDebanInterval channel configuration setting command
	for telling the bot when (in minutes) to auto-unban old 
	channel bans.
   o	Changes to party line
	- The status messages are changed a bit.
	- Added "/PME action" command for sending actions to the party line
	- Party line users will not be automatically disconnected
	  due to excess idle.
	- Commands through party line, and DCC CHAT in general, 
	  *must* be prefixed by the '/' character.  The standard 
	  bot prefix character may not even work.

Version 5.6b ---------------------------------------------------
   o	Fixed bug in ban, who channel lists -- introduced in 5.6a

Version 5.6a ---------------------------------------------------
   o	Fixed the ".s" version in regards to file transfer:
	- the FILELIST, UPLOADDIR and DOWNLOADDIR should work fine now
	- the greeting of users is fixed -- the greeting file was not
	  read in at all previously
   o	Added stacked channel mode replies; hopefully reduces flooding.
   o	Fixed: the deop protection would not deop offender even if the
	protected user has a high enough protect level.
   o	Upon joining a channel, the bot will scan for people on the 
	autokick list and will autokick any found.
   o	Fixed the LS command when used with patterns
	- the use of pattern will prevent the comments from showing up
	  unless the comments match the specified pattern.
   o	Added "CtcpRespond" bot configuration toggle command.  If enabled,
	allows the bot to reply to CTCP requests.
	- Also added "BT.CTCP" bot online toggle command.
   o	Added spying of CTCP requests.

Version 5.6 ----------------------------------------------------
    o	Reorganized the flood check/ignore.
	- Settings to detect flooding are now set with FLOODSET
	  configuration command: reset, interval and lines for
	  public, private, and dcc messages.
	- This means FLOODSET "MSGS, PUBMSGS, and DCCMSGS" all work now,
	  as well as all of the parameters
	- Deleted MSGFLOODRATE as that is taken care of by "FLOODSET MSGS"
	- Added runtime global configuration setting commands
	  GS.(PFR, PFI, PFL, MFR, MFI, MFL, DFR, DFI, DFL), for
	  Public, (private), and Dcc message settings.
	  - The 'R' is for reset setting, in seconds (to reset flooding status)
	  - The 'I' is for interval setting, in seconds.
	  - The 'L' is for lines to detect in interval set above.
    o	Added "TOGGLE" and "SET" configuration prefix commands.
	- TOGGLE takes the place of "!" in front of toggle config. commands.
	- SET takes the place of "%" in front of setting config. commands.
    o	Fixed the problem with nick change on being kicked from a channel
	and the bot not returning...and no wonder (!!)
    o	Added "BT CKN" and "DoCheckNote" configuration bot toggle command
	for deciding whether to check for notes for people joining a channel.
    o	Changed the CK, KK, KB, etc kick commands so it will -not- show
	who requested the kick, just that it has been requested.

Version 5.5b ---------------------------------------------------
    o	Command "AWAY" can now take parameter "-" to take off the away message.
    o	A protected user that is kicked from a channel will be invited back
	if the bot is opped.
    o	Changed nick randomization after enough (16) failed NICK registrations.
    o	Added response to "CTCP WHO <channel>" so users can make the bot look 
	for server info of users in <channel> that the bot is also in.
    o	Command "LS" will only list the files to which the user has access to.
	- Also, the access level is not shown anymore.
    o	Fixed: STAT command _will_ show output even if a user is not in
	the userlist.  This means people on autokick can also be listed.
    o	Fixed: "USER ADD -*pattern*" now fills in the pattern's nick as
	something like "<UNKNOWN>" or "-" rather than leaving it blank.
    o	Users with access 950 and above CAN be marked as flooding; the 
	previous change could impose unneeded system overhead.

Version 5.5a ---------------------------------------------------
    o	Fixed the AK.ADD of userhost after the code change.
    o	Fixed the PASSWORD info in "STAT" output after code change.
    o	Active Server Info gathering is off by default.

Version 5.5 ----------------------------------------------------
    o	NOTE: "TOGGLE" configuration command support is now removed --
	always toggle settings in infile.cfg with the '!' prefix
    o	NOTE: "SET" configuration command support is now removed --
	always set settings in infile.cfg with the '%' prefix
    o	NOTE: entries in "filelist.bot" with "-----" can be filenames.
	- Previously, entries with "-----" are taken as comments.
    o	Removed MDBF command -- not much use anyways
    o	Configurable auto dcc connection:
	- Added "AutoDccConnect" configuration bot toggle command  
	- Added "BT ADCC" online bot toggle command
    o	Speeded up command recognition.
    o	Added WHOS command.  It is a terse version of the WHO command,
	but also showing a user's server as well.
    o	The CHI output is changed a bit to make it more compact.
	- the Active Channel Status indicator is '*' and '@' for active
	  and opped.
    o	Added AUTOREJOIN channel toggle configuration command to turn on
	auto-rejoin.  By default, the bot will leave a channel when someone
	tells it to and won't rejoin after a time by itself.
    o	Changed USER.RELOAD command so you can optionally load in another
	user file provided you have at least 990 access.
    o	Incorporated NSL2 to the NSL command.
    o	Incorporated ACT to the ACT2 command.  A shortcut to act to the
	present channel is with the "." identifier.
    o	Fixed that random nick change bug.
    o	Added "ServerInfo" bot toggle configuration to turn off/on
	server info gathering for channel users.
    o	Added "BT SI" to toggle the above while online; default is on.
	- Active server info gathering is off if the bot is in "war" mode.
    o	Changes to channel joining and getting channel information; 
	this should make the bot a bit faster
    o	Fixed the bug with specifying the server option from NEWBOT command
	but the bot wouldn't use the server since the port is wrong if
	the port option is not specified.
    o	Partially fixed the bug with userlist corruption due to using 
	NEWBOT command.  NOTE: You -MUST- kill forked bots first if you
	need to reduce the number of active bots or else your userlist will
	be in jeopardy.
    o	Changed the bot's prefix word to be case sensitive.
    o	Added identd checking when auto-opping users.
	- To change this feature for individual users, see "USER IDENTD" cmd.
    o	Users on machines not using identd cannot use the universal
	tnt2bot prefix word "tnt2" to issue commands.
    o	Added capability to change the user protection scheme:
	- Added BT.PAD bot toggle command for changing the user protection
	  scheme.  PAD stands for "Protect Access Difference", meaning the
	  higher a user's access, the more likely that user is protected.
	- Added "ProtAccessDiff" configuration bot toggle command for
	  doing the above -- BT.PAD.
	- By default, user protection is in accordance with protection
	  levels given.
	- Access difference and protection levels are set as follows:
	  - access difference > 700, protection = 3
	  - access difference > 400, protection = 2
	  - access difference > 100, protection = 1
    o	Bot nick in log files now uses up to 9 spaces, more if necessary.
	- This allows for easy checking of log time.
	- The nick is left justified if the length is not 9 chars. long.
    o	Fixed: the bot will again greet people who use the trigger phrases:
	"Hey", "Hi", "Hi <botnick>", "Re", "Hello", "Re <botnick>",
	"Re All", "Hi All", "Hello All", "Hello <botnick>",
	"Bye <botnick>", and "Bye all"
	- NOTE: trigger phrases are case-insensitive.
    o	Fixed: the bot should not kick itself for nick flooding, not that
	the bot should be nick flooding in the first place.
    o	Fixed: the bot no longer shows two (2) messages with "NO INFORMATION
	AVAILABLE FOR .." in the "STAT" command.
    o	Fixed: the multi-port server entries for bot works properly.
	NOTE: You have to make sure you only have one entry of the server
	with the particular port or you'll have duplicate entries with
	duplicate ports in the bot's server list.
