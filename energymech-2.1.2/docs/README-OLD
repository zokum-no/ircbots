Before you start to try to run a bot...

Be sure that you are allowed to have bot on your machine and know what type
and version of unix you have. Also, you should know some basic unix
commands before you begin.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Get the Bot code

  2. Unzip the bot by typing

                gunzip (botfile name)

  3. Untar the bot by typing

                tar -xvf (botfile name)

  4. Edit the EnergyMech.set file to your liking.
  5. Edit the file called EnergyMech.lists like so

               User= *!*@*
            Channel= *
              Level= 100
                Aop= 1
               Prot= 4
               Time= 805186048
                Who= It!DONt@matter.net

     But for the user add your login and host. Example: My login is sdeal1
     and my host is umbc.edu. So I would make the User line this

     User= *!*sdeal1@*.umbc.edu

  6. Edit the EnergyMech.levels file if you feel like it.
  7. Edit the following lines in include/config.h

     #define DEFAULT_OWNERUH "*!*comstud@*texas.net"
     #define DEFAULT_SERVER  "fucking.fuck.i.don't.exist"
     #define DEFAULT_PORT    6667
     #define DEFAULT_IRCNAME "Blow me, okay?"
     #define DEFAULT_LOGIN   "comstud"
     #define DEFAULT_CMDCHAR '-'

     (NOTE: I seemed to noticed all you really have to change is the
     DEFAULT_SERVER line since the other lines come from the Bot.Set file.)
  8. Edit the on_msg_commands[] table in the source/com-ons.c file if your
     the hacker type.
  9. Edit the source/Makefile to what your system has.
 10. Now, from the main Bot directory type the word make
 11. If it compiled successfully then your almost there! Now just type the
     word EnergyMech and it will automatically run in the background. Then get
     on IRC and have FUN!!! (NOTE: It sometimes takes a while for the bot
     to connect to a server so have some patience.)

     If it did NOT compile successfully then check More Help for some
     additional help.
     
 12. Once your bot is on-line then try botchk or a sh script to keep your
     bot on-line.
 13. If you care to Debug your bot then just start combot by typing 
     EnergyMech -b -d 2
