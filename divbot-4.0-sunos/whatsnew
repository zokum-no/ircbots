=divbot 4.0=


i forgot most of the changes in this version.  figure them out yourself...

some of them are:

additional protection level.  now level 1 means unban/no re-op, level 2 
means both unban and reop.  and everything else shift one number up.

you can specify SETFL, SETTOL, and SETNT in divset. (see the sample
divset)

the bot is not stable yet.
i have a log file for bugs. called "divbug"
if you find lines in the logfile, you can email me and i will see what i 
can do.


mail me if you found problems.  have fun
