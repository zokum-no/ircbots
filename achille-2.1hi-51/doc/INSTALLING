How to install VladBot
----------------------
From version 2.0 it's no longer needed to edit the config.h file
for configuring, all the important settings can be defined at 
runtime in the configuration file. For more information look at 
the distributed configuration files in doc/ and change ont of them
to your needs.

It's still needed to create your own userlist, shitlist and 
protlist. For a simple startup, all you need to do is create these
three files with the names "user.list", "shit.list" and "prot.list"
(unless you named them differently in the configfile) and put a
pattern in it that matches your nickname!user@host.domain.
Usually, this pattern will look like "*!*user@*.domain"
In the userlist, put "150" after the pattern. In the protfile
"100" and in the shitlist "0".

After you (hopefully succesfully) compiled the source by typing "make"
in the vladbot directory and you created all the needed files, you 
should be ready to run the bot!

Where to find more information:
- Information about the configuration file can be found in the
  file "sample.cfg", which should be distributed with the botpackage.
  The other two files are just examples, they don't show any real info.
- Information about Commands and userlists can be found in the file
  "help.bot". Read it using your favorite filebrowser or use the
  "helpread" program which should be created when "make-ing" the bot.
  And of course, /msg YourBot !help
