  "See the stone set in your eyes, see the thorn twist in your side."
 " sleep comes like a drug in God's country .. sad eyes crooked crosses in God's country .. "
 " in the distance she saw me coming and .. I was calling out I was calling out"
 " by the side of the road .. by the side of the hill as the valley explode ... dislocated .. suffocated .. "
