".. I wanna feel you from the inside .."
"dear abby dear abby you have no complaint, ya are what ya are and ya aint what ya aint"
 "bow down before the one you serve..."
"God money I'll do anything for you...God money just tell me what you want me to.."
 "God is dead and no one cares.  If there is a hell, I will see you there."
 Gave up trying to figure it out, my head got lost along the way.  worn out from giving up, my soul I pissed it all away...
