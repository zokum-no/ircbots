 ".. Margret Thatcher on T.V...  Shocked by the deaths that took place in Bejing...  It seems strange that she should be offended...  The same orders are given by her... "
 ".. I've said this before now... You said I was childish and you'll say it now...  Remember what I told you...  If they hated me they will hate you.. "
 "..In My Soul.. My Blood and my Bones..  I have warpped your cold bodies around me...  The face on you..  The smell of you..  Will always be with me.
