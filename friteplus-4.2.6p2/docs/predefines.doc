Preprocessor Definitions
------------------------
As per this release (v4.3) of the fRitE+, the preprocessor definitions are
not implimented.  What they will provide in the future however is a 
way to reduce the binary size, if you are not going to be using
some of the features of the bot.  Look for these features in fRitE+ v4.5
