In the beginning...
-------------------
I'll keep this short and simple.  fRitE's have been the only bot I've run that
have been stable, and back-door free.  This isn't to say that they weren't
without they're quirks.  Anyways, OffSpring has let it known that he doesn't
want to code the fRitE's anymore, so I decided to try my hand.  I started on
this series, which I call fRitE+.  I worked on a few of the functions that
were not working properly, and added a few more.  See the "whats.new" file to
find out what has been changed.

I've worked my butt off to organize the files, and make the compile routine
like all these changes.  I hope this directory structure makes it easier to 
configure the bot, and keep things sane.

Please report any bugs to Pyber (pyber@alias.undernet.org).  I'll try to sort
out the problem for ya.  Please include an err.log any core files?  Here
is an easy way to create a good bug log.

	1) Compile with #define DBUG
	2) Start the bot with <botname> -b > trace.log &
	3) gzip the trace.log and mail it to me with a description
	   of any error messages and what you were doing.


Installing a fRitE+ the easy way.
---------------------------------
Ok, to install a fRitE+ the easy way, simple follow these easy steps...

	1) Edit the src/config.h file and make the appropriate changes.
	   See docs/defines for more information on this.
	2) Edit the src/Makefile file and make the appropriate changes.
	   Changes for this section are heavy commented.
	3) Edit the infile.cfg file and make the appropriate changes.
	   See docs/config_file.doc
	4) Type "make" in the Bot's main dir.
	5) Run your bot.

Due to the large number of people unable to configure their bots properly, and
the fact that there have been a large number of "fake fRitE"'s that have been
appearing on "#Chat", the config.h, Makefile, and infile.cfg will NOT work
until you make the correct changes.  This is our attempt at idiot-proofing the
bot.
