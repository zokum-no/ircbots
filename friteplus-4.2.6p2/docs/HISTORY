4.2.1 - Started out this entire adventure.  Added the RULE and ARULE functions.

	Basically just used this revision to "play" and learn what the various
	functions and structures did.

4.2.2 - Added the POET and APOET functions.

	Broke the HELP file into two files.  One for regular help, and one for
	ophelp.  Ophelp can only be accessed by people with a level => 50. 

	

4.2.6 - Fixed the security hole in sing, lyrics, and ascii.  Thanks to Chaos
        for this one! :)

  	Various errors fixed in function.c.  It should now compile on more
	systems than it previously could.  Many many many thanks go to Lumena
	for this! :)
