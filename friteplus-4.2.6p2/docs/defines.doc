Definitions in the config.h file
--------------------------------
Here's a quick explanation of the #define's found in the config.h
file.  Don't expect much in the way of verbosity..

IRCNAME		- This defined the nick of the bot.

USERNAME	- This is the username of your bot on the IRC.  This
		  should be the account name from which your bot is
		  run.  If not, this could lead to troubles with the
		  IRCops.

IRCGECOS	- This is the IRC Name of your bot.  It's what shown
		  between the ()'s on a whois.

PUBLIC_NICK	- This is the name which your bot will respond to, like
		  fRitE or SucKeR.  If you are using the publics, this
		  must be defined.

USERFILE	- This defines where the bot will find the userlists.
		  This can also be set in the infile.cfg, but this is the
		  hard coded-value.

SHITFILE	- This defines where the bot will find the shitlists.
		  This can also be set in the infile.cfg, but this is the
		  hard coded-value.

PROTFILE	- This defines where the bot will find the protlists.
		  This can also be set in the infile.cfg, but this is the
		  hard coded-value.

DCCLOGFILE	- This defines where the bot will put the log of DCC
		  transfers.

ERRFILE		- This defines where the bot will but the log of ERRORS.
		  Remember, if you are a sending a bug report, an
		  error log is appriecated.. :)

LOGFILE		- This defines where the bot will put the channel logs.
	 	  The bot will create one logfile per channel, as well
		  as keeping a seperate command log.

FILEROOTDIR	- This defines the "root" directory for you file 
		  transfers.  The bot performs a chroot() on that dir,
		  so the users cannot change into the parent dir.

CONTENTSFILE	- This defines where to find the contents file.

FILEUPLOADDIR	- This is where the bot will place all the incoming files.

PUB_FILE	- This is where the public reactions are stored. 

HELPFILE	- This defines where the bot can find the help file.

OPHELPFILE	- This defines where the bot can fine the ophelp file.

NOTEFILE	- This defines where the bot can read/write the note file.

BONKFILE	- This is the file with the bonk objects.

QUOTEFILE	- This is the files with the discordian quotes.

TOPICFILE	- This file stores the random topics.

BULLFILE	- This is where the bulletins are stored.

RULEFILE	- This is where the rules are stored.

POETFILE	- This is where the poetry is stored.

NEWSFILE	- This is where the news is stored.

LIBFILE		- For the catalog of ASCII art.

LYRICFILE	- For the catalog of songs.

SPLATFILE	- This is where the splatter kicks is stored.

DANCEFILE	- This is where the  dances are stored.

REPLYFILE	- Domn't touch this definition or file.

INSULTFILE	- The insults are stored in here.

PICDIR		- This is the directory where the bot can find it's
		  picture files.  The directory should end with a 
		  trailing "/".

SONGDIR		- This is the directory where the bot can find it's
		  song files.  The directory should end with a 
		  trailing "/".

ASSTLVL 125	- This is the assistant level.  Right now this is only
		  functional in a few commands.  Leave it as is, or raise
		  it to 150.  It should not be less than 125.

KICKSAYLVL	- Anybody with a level greater than the KICKSAYLVL will
		  be excempt from being kicked if they say a banned 
		  word or phrase.

ENFORCE_MODES	- Define this if you want mode enforcement.

LOG		- Define this if you want channel loggins on by default.

GREET		- Define this if you want the bot to greet people.  If
		  this is defined, the bot will great anybody with a level
		  equal to or greater than the ASSTLVL.

PUBLICS		- Define this if you want public reactions.


SING		- Define this if you want the bot to be able to sing.

SHITCOMMENT	- This is unused at the moment.  You can leave as is.

DCC_IDLETIMEOUT 
DCC_WAITTIMEOUT 
DCC_MAXFILESIZE - For maximum stability, I recommend leaving these values as
		  is.  Their meanings should be self-explanitor.  If you do
		  not want large files DCCed to the bot, reduce
		  DCC_MAXFILESIZE.  It's value is in bytes.

AUTO_DCC	- Define this if you want the bot to autmatically start a 
		  DCC chat if it is required for the command.

AUTO_OPLVL	- This is the level at which people entering the channel will
		  be auto-opped.

PREFIX_CHAR	- This is the prefix character for public commands.

CFGFILE		- This is the default configuration file to use, if none is
		  specified on the command line.

DBUG		- Define this if you want debugging.

If a #define appears in the config.h, but not in this document, it is best to 
leave the #define alone, unless you understand what it does.  All #define's are 
set by default to allow for the most flexibility and stability.
