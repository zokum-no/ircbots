Upgrading from a 4.0 or 4.1x fRite
----------------------------------
If you are now faced with the troubles up upgrading from an earlier fRite,
this document should help you get up and running in the least amount of
time.  First off, copy all of your *.list files(User, Shit, and Protect)
into the bot_lists/ directory.  Edit your user.list file, and make sure
that you give yourself level 175 on the bot.  This is required if you
want access to all the commands.

Your infile.cfg can still be used.  Copy your old infile.cfg into the
fRitE+ main directory, and then edit it to point the lists to the
bot_lists/ directory.  (Eg, bot_lists/user.list bot_lists/shit.list)

Sorry, but you CANNOT use your old config.h file.  You are going to have
to edit the default config.h file to match your current needs.  There are
alot of new variables defined in the config.h now, so you need to have
them all in order to be able to compile the bot.

The help system has been redone, breaking it into two sections, 
regular help, and ophelp.  There are two new default files provided
with the new fRitE+.  If you want to customize the news, publics,
bulletins, etc, all the *.bot files are in the bot_files/ directory.
