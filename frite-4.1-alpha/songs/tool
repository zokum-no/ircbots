".. choices always were a problem for you.. what you need is someone strong to guide you.. deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow .."
"This is necessary.....life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on this is necessary..."
"Why can't we not be sober?  I just want to start this over.."
 ".. i know you well, you are a part of me, i know you better than i know myself; i know you best, better than anyone, i know you better than i know myself, YOU ARE A PART OF ME .."
 ".. take what is mine, hold what is mine, suffocate what is mine, bury what's mine, 'til the water will come and claim what is mine, I must leave it behind and come to a new place now .."
 ".. sun is beating hot again, on the hunter and the fisherman, and I'm trying to remember when, but it makes me dizzy .."
