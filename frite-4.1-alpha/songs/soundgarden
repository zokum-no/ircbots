".. Whatsoever I've cured . I've sickened now .. Whomsoever I've cradled .. I've put you down .."
".. The day I tried to live .. I stole a thousand beggar's change .. And gave it to the rich .."
"Hate, if ya wanna hate....if it keeps ya safe...if it makes you brave!"
"Don't come over here...piss on my gate...Save it just keep it off my wave!"
