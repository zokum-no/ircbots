".. Time to take her home .. Her dizzy head is concious laden .. Time to wait to long .. to wait to long .."
".. If you should die before me ask if you can bring a friend .. Pick a flower .. Hold your breath and drift away .."
".. Waiting .. On a Sunday afternoon .. For what I read between the lines .. Your lies .."
".. Have you lost your mother girl ..? Has she gone away ..? .."
"isn't it you? isn't it me? search for things that you can't see.. going blind, out of reach. somewhere in the vasaline..."
