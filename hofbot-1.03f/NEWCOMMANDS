The following are new commands in addition to those commands in Hackbot.hlp.
####################

### Feb. 3, 1996 ###

26. TogWarOn
Usage: TogWarOn
    An extremely defensive toggle that protects a channel. 
    When WarOn toggle is on, the bot will ignore all ctcp, 
    private, and public messages that are done by non-users
   (0 access level).  This a very secure way to ignore floods 
   and thus stabilize the bot.  In addition, it will make the
   bot respond and act much quickly.  The only disadvantage is
   that the bot won't kick people that are flooding in public.
