Hi botters. 

This divbot is modified from comstud's hackbot, with bugs fixed here and 
there and few functions added.

Any problem just email msg me while i am on or email me at:
		curl@rabi.phys.columbia.edu
welcome all comments, suggestions.. blah blah

Ok, first of all..  i am lazy..  i usually don't update any changes in 
a file (will, i used to, and maybe i should begin again..)  So i can't 
tell you now what's been changed/fixed/added.  figure those parts urself :)

In the version I released, I disabled the colliding functions for few 
good purposes.  don't want to ruin this nice chatting place and don't 
want to get backfired someday.

Anyway, to START the bot:

1. type "divinstall", then follow the directions to setup DIVSET. 

2. load the bot by "divbot"

3. learn how to use the bot by using the help function:
		/msg BOTNICK divbot help topics
 
If anything goes wrong, that you cannot control it, blah blah, 
or the cputime/mem went up too high, you can type "killbot" to terminate it.


Finally, have fun and good luck.
