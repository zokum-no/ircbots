IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
With the addition of the message center 6 new .lists have been created every
user with have an entry in each file that they have access to..ie
level 100 users have entries in the 100.list,75.list,50.list and the number
there represents the number of messages they've read from the message
database. Also currently you MUST run the bot from the directory where
these lists are stored..in future versions I will fix this limitation.

In this version the above problem is FIX, be sure to look at the NEW
infile.cfg which shows how to specify where these .list files are.



Ok..file explanations:

access.list:  

format:  command level

purpose:  Change the access level for <command> without having to recompile
the code


nick.list:

format:  nick

purpose:  List of nicks to use with the !nickch command



shit.list2:

format: nick!user@host reason

purpose:  Shitlevel description for kick ban


passwd.list:

format: nick!user@host password

purpose:  The password for user to gain access to channel commands


New additions not in the help file:
!one command allows you to be authed for one comand

!one <passwd> <command>

!readaccess command reads the access.list file
