TODO List for ChRoniCbot
========================
- Get the damn BOTNet working good!
- Use BOTNet to sync lists.
- Daily/Total stats (kicking/opping/joins/parts)?
- Figure out whats up with the !mailpasswd which used to work.  Could be
  just another FreeBSD weirdality.
- Put the talk code into its own file and a table.
